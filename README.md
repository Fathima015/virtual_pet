### Project Description
This project brings to life a virtual pet rock, allowing you to adopt and interact with your own digital companion right in your browser. You can name your pet, share your thoughts with it, and even customize its look with a variety of fun accessories. It's a delightful, low-maintenance pet experience designed to bring a smile to your face.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
 Dogs need walking, cats demand feeding, and hamsters are secretly plotting world domination from their wheels. We're solving the problem of high-maintenance companionship by offering a pet that requires nothing but your occasional, fleeting attention and thrives on digital silence.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We're providing a revolutionary, browser-based pet rock that offers the emotional stability of a geological formation. It listens to your problems without interrupting, agrees with all your life choices by saying nothing at all, and its only need is for you to occasionally dress it up in a tiny bow tie. It's the perfect pet for the modern human: all of the companionship, none of the commitment.
